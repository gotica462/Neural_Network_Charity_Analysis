# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis

Use machine learning and neural networks and the features in the provided dataset to help create a binary classifier that is capable of predicting whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup. From Alphabet Soupâ€™s business team, we received a CSV containing more than 34,000 organizations that have received funding from Alphabet Soup over the years. Within this dataset are a number of columns that capture metadata about each organization. We'll clean the data and provide a model to determine the probability that the money goes to a succesful charity.
